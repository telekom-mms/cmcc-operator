# Kubernetes Operator for CoreMedia Content Cloud

[![build](https://github.com/Telekom-MMS/cmcc-operator/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Telekom-MMS/cmcc-operator/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**Important** Since June 4, 2024, this repo has moved from T-Systems-MMS/cmcc-operator to Telekom-MMS/cmcc-operator. While Github will automatically redirect requests for the Git repo, the Helm repo URL has to be adjusted manually.

In particular, you will need to update your Helm repo URL like this:
```shell
helm repo add --force-update cmcc-operator https://telekom-mms.github.io/cmcc-operator/
helm repo update
```

## Introduction

[Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) are specialized software packages that help manage applications and resources in a k8s cluster. This operator will create, initialize and run a [CoreMedia Content Cloud](https://www.coremedia.com) application. A custom resource definition is used to define all relevant parameters.

## Features

The operator:

* manages the creation and updating of all the Kubernetes resources required to run CoreMedia Content Cloud. Care has
  been taken to have sensible defaults for all parameters wherever possible.
* can create a fresh installation from scratch, creating MariaDB and MongoDB database servers, and initialize the
  necessary database schemas and secrets, suitable for a development environment. For production, persistence should be
  provided, for example by using cloud services, or using other operators to provision databases.
* can deploy against existing databases, using pre-existing secrets provided.
* can use a custom resource definition or a config map to supply the values. This makes it possible to use the operator
  even on clusters where you cannot install cluster-wide resources.
* deploys the CoreMedia Content Cloud components step by step. This ensures that components that require other
  components are only started when the dependencies have been initialized successfully.
* imports test users and contents initially.
* run additional jobs, for example to re-import content into a running installation.
* configures the live CAE deployment with the desired number of replicas.
* builds ingresses automatically from CAE site mappings.
* can create random passwords for all components and configures the components to use them (MariaDB, MongoDB, and
  UAPI/Corba). You can override any or all secrets for these usernames and password.
* configures Solr clustering by specifying the number of replicas to create.
* configures Solr BASIC Auth for solr leader, follower and clients if it is enabled.
* configures zero or more Replication Live Servers to provide redundancy in the delivery/live stage.
* supports CoreMedia Content Cloud 11.

Planned features include:
* Support for Traefik ingress controller and its resource types (in addition to the [kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)).
* Admission webhook that verifies consistency of the custom resource, and can migrate between CRD versions.
* Configuring a horizontal pod autoscaler for the live CAEs.

## Preparing Your Cluster and Installing the Operator

In order to use the operator, your Kubernetes cluster needs to be prepared. You can then install the operator, and create a CoreMedia Content Cloud installation through the operator.

### Preparing the Kubernetes Cluster

#### Ingress Controller
In order for the CoreMedia installation to be accessible from outside the cluster, an Ingress Controller needs to be configured. The operator currently only supports the generation of Ingress resources for the [Ingress NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) controller. Follow the instructions there to install the ingress controller, or use Helm:

```shell
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace --set controller.ingressClassResource.default=true
```

Your cluster will need to have a load balancer available, so the ingress controller can be reached. Please refer to your cluster documentation for more information.

### Required DNS Names

In order for users to be able to access the CoreMedia websites, you will need to provide DNS names (ingress hostnames) and have them point at the ingress controllers IP address.

If you don't have a domain handy for a development setup, for example on your local machine, you can use a DNS service like [nip.io](https://nip.io) or [sslip.io](https://sslip.io). This allows you to configure `defaults.ingressDomain: 127.0.0.1.nip.io`.

All host names are built by the following components: 
- `defaults.namePrefix`
- `defaults.nameSuffix`
- `defaults.namePrefixForIngressDomain`
- `defaults.nameSuffixForIngressDomain`
- the `defaults.ingressDomain`

As the `namePrefix` and the `nameSuffix` are used also for the container-names, what is not always wanted, it is possible to use `namePrefixForIngressDomain` and `nameSuffixForIngressDomain` instead. Both of them are only used to build the DNS name.

If `namePrefix` and `namePrefixForIngressDomain` are used, `namePrefixForIngressDomain` overrides `namePrefix` to build the DNS name. But only the `namePrefix` and the `nameSuffix` are used to create the container name.  

See below for [Site Mappings](docs/custom-resource.md#site-mappings). Examples:

| namePrefix | namePrefixForIngressDomain | component/site | ingressDomain    | nameSuffix | nameSuffixForIngressDomain | Resulting URL                               |
|------------|----------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| –          | -                          | overview       | 127.0.0.1.nip.io | -          | -                          | https://overview.127.0.0.1.nip.io           |
| –          | -                          | studio         | 127.0.0.1.nip.io | -          | -                          | https://studio.127.0.0.1.nip.io             |

### Using Docker Desktop

If you're using Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows, you can have **exactly one service** bind to localhost port 80 and 443. Installing the ingress controller should bind to those ports, and ingresses will be available through localhost on your host machine. Make sure that no other Docker container is using these ports.

### Using k3d

If you're using [k3d](https://k3d.io/) as a cluster, your Docker install will need to [expose the ingress controller](https://k3d.io/v5.0.0/usage/exposing_services/).

## Installing the Operator

### Installing the Operator Using the Helm Chart

The [Helm chart cmcc-operator](charts/cmcc-operator) can be used to install and configure the operator.

```console
$ helm repo add cmcc-operator https://t-systems-mms.github.io/cmcc-operator/
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace cmcc-operator cmcc-operator cmcc-operator/cmcc-operator
```

### Installing the Operator Manually
Alternatively, you can use the example Kubernetes resource definitions in [k8s/](k8s):

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/cmcc-crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/cmcc-operator.yaml
```
or for the impatient:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T-Systems-MMS/cmcc-operator/main/k8s/cmcc-crd.yaml -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T-Systems-MMS/cmcc-operator/main/k8s/cmcc-operator.yaml
```

### Using the Custom Resource Definition

You need to add the [Custom Resource Definition](k8s/cmcc-crd.yaml) `CoreMediaContentClouds` (or `cmcc` for short) to the cluster, and create a number of objects for the operator: a ClusterRole, a ClusterRoleMapping, a ServiceAccount, and a Deployment for the operator. An example can be found in [`k8s/cmcc-operator.yaml`](k8s/cmcc-operator.yaml).


### Using a Config Map

If installing the custom resource definition is not an option for you, you can install the operator and have it act on ConfigMaps. The operator can work on ConfigMaps in any namespace (if the role allows it), or can be limited to a single namespace.

When installing the Operator, you need to set the Spring Boot property `cmcc.useConfigMap` to `true`, and `cmcc.useCrd` to `false`. You can set these in the Helm chart, for example with `--set cmcc.useConfigMap=true`.

If you're installing the operator manually, you will need to set the environment variables `CMCC_USECONFIGMAP` and `CMCC_USECRD` on the deployment for the operator.

## Configuring the Operator

The operator has a number of configuration parameters that can be set using the [usual Spring Boot ways](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.22.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html): as an application.properties or application.yaml file, or using environment variables. The following properties can be configured:

| Property              | Environment           | Default     | Description                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cmcc.ingressbuilder` | `CMCC_INGRESSBUILDER` | `blueprint` | The ingress builder to use. See [site mappings](docs/custom-resource.md#automatic-generation-of-ingresses-and-site-mappings-sitemappings) | 
| `cmcc.useConfigMap`   | `CMCC_USECONFIGMAP`   | `false`     | Use the ConfigMap reconciler (see [Using a Config Map](#using-a-config-map))              | 
| `cmcc.useCrd`         | `CMCC_USECRD`         | `true`      | Use the Custom Resource reconciler                                                                                                        | 
## Using the Operator

### Pull Secret

Depending on you cluster setup and whether you're using a custom registry, you will likely need a pull secret for the pods to be able to pull their images. The operator relies on the default service account having the necessary pull secrets configured for the namespace the CoreMedia installation will be created in.

### License Files

In order for the Content Server components to work they need license files. Create a secret each for the three types of Content Server with the contents of the `license.zip` like so:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic license-cms --from-file=license.zip=license/cms-license.zip 
```

The license secrets need to be created in the same namespace you plan to install CoreMedia in. See `licenseSecrets`, below.

### Creating a CoreMedia Installation - Helm Chart

The [Helm chart cmcc](charts/cmcc) can be used to create a deployment for CoreMedia Content Cloud. See the documentation there for information on how to supply the necessary values to Helm.

````shell
$ helm repo add cmcc-operator https://t-systems-mms.github.io/cmcc-operator/
$ helm upgrade --install my-release cmcc-operator/cmcc --values my-values.yaml
````

### Creating a CoreMedia Installation - Custom Resource

You can create a complete CoreMedia installation by creating the custom resource `CoreMediaContentClouds` with the desired properties. An example can be found in [`k8s/example.yaml`](k8s/example.yaml), and can be created in the cluster like this:

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/example.yaml
```

[docs/custom-resource.md](docs/custom-resource.md) describes all available properties of the `CoreMediaContentClouds` custom resource.

After the resource has been created, you can monitor the status:
```shell
$ kubectl get CoreMediaContentClouds
NAME     MILESTONE
obiwan   Created
```
See below for the different milestones and their meaning.

### Creating a CoreMedia Installation - ConfigMap

If you have enabled using a ConfigMap instead (or in addition to) the custom resource, you need to create a ConfigMap that maps the custom resource properties `spec` and `status` to `data` entries, and has a label `"cmcc.tsystemsmms.com.customresource": "cmcc"`. See the [`example-config.yaml`](k8s/example-configmap.yaml).

The status display is slightly more complicated, you will need a custom client or script to extract the milestone from the ConfigMap `status` entry, and patching the `job` entry likewise requires editing the entire `spec` entry of the ConfigMap. However, the operation is otherwise the same as with the custom resource.


### Deleting the CoreMedia Installation

To have the operator remove all components, including the databases and their PVCs, simply delete the custom resource:
```shell
kubectl delete CoreMediaContentClouds example
```

Depending on your cluster, the deletion might take a minute.


## Building The Operator

You build the Docker image for the Operator and load it into your local Docker with this command:
```shell
./gradlew build jibDockerBuild
```

You can use `./gradlew jib` to build and push the image to a Docker registry. See the documentation for [Job Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin).
