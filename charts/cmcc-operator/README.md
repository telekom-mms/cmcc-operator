# CoreMedia Content Cloud Operator

The [CoreMedia Content Cloud Operator](https://github.com/Telekom-MMS/cmcc-operator) provides an easy to use way to
manage deployments of [CoreMedia Content Cloud](https://www.coremedia.com/). This Helm chart allows you to install the
operator; an accompanying chart helps managing the custom resource or config map to manage an individual deployment.

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add cmcc-operator https://t-systems-mms.github.io/cmcc-operator/
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace cmcc-operator cmcc-operator cmcc-operator/cmcc-operator
```

## Introduction

The [CoreMedia Content Cloud Operator](https://github.com/Telekom-MMS/cmcc-operator) provides an easy to use way to
manage deployments of [CoreMedia Content Cloud](https://www.coremedia.com/). This Helm chart allows you to install the
operator; an accompanying chart helps managing the custom resource or config map to manage an individual deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `cmcc-operator`:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace cmcc-operator cmcc-operator cmcc-operator/cmcc-operator
```

The command deploys the operator on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters)
section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `cmcc-operator` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete cmcc-operator
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration and Installation Details

### Custom Resource

The operator gets the desired configuration from a custom resource of type `CoreMediaContentClouds`. If `cmcc.useCrd` is enabled (default), the chart will install the appropriate `CustomResourceDefinition`.

If you cannot install a CRD, you can disable `cmcc.useCrd` and enable `cmcc.useConfigMap`, to supply the configuration for a deployment using a config map instead of the custom resource. See [Using a Config Map](https://github.com/Telekom-MMS/cmcc-operator#using-a-config-map) for further details.

### Role-based Access Control

If you install the operator in its default configuration, it will monitor `CoreMediaContentClouds` custom resources cluster-wide. In order for the operator to be allowed to work that way, a `ClusterRole` and a `ClusterRoleBinding` are installed together with a `ServiceAccount`, granting the operator the appropriate rights. This includes config maps, deployments and statefulsets, pvc and ingresses.

If `cmcc.manageSecrets` is enabled (default), the operator will automatically generated secrets for UAPI clients and (if the custom resources has `with.databases` enabled) database accounts. This requires that the operator can read and write any secret cluster-wide. If you disable `cmcc.manageSecrets`, the right to manage secrets is removed from the `ClusterRole`, and you will need to:
* supply any and all secrets yourself
* configure the Content Server components (Content Management Server, Master Live Server, and any Replication Live Server) to change the passwords for the default system accounts from their defaults to the values provided in your secrets.

Of course, you can disable both `clusterrole.create` and `serviceaccount.create`, and provide your custom RBAC configuration for the operator yourself.
